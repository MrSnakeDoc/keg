# Security Policy

The maintainer of Keg takes security seriously. If you discover
a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **DO NOT** file a public issue, instead send your report privately
to [security@nexacloud.dev](mailto:security@nexacloud.dev).

You can expect a response within 72 hours, acknowledging the issue was
received.

## Review Process

After receiving the report, we will perform an initial analysis to:
1. Confirm the vulnerability
2. Determine its scope and impact
3. Plan necessary fixes

Once confirmed, we will:
1. Create a draft security advisory on GitHub
2. Develop and test a fix
3. Release a patch
4. Publicly disclose the issue once patched

## Supported Versions

This project only maintains the current release and `main` branch.
Previous versions are not supported and users are encouraged to
always use the latest version.
